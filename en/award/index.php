Another significant success came at the Pony League tournament, where he pitched in the final and helped the team win, which opened the way for them to the prestigious tournament in the USA. During the season, he not only defended the colors of our club in the First League, but also got into the extra league team Tempa Praha with his performances. Thanks to his commitment and performances, he eventually made it to the U18 national team. He is an example of tireless diligence and talent that inspires other players and pushes the level of our team ever higher.</p>
